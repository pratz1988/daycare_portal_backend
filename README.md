# Day Care Portal App (backend)

I built the Full stack application as part of my GA ( General Assembly ) SEI bootcamp. This app is built to faciliate parent teacher inteaction in a day care setup, where parents will be abel to view what children have been doing and teachers will be able to post the activity and also inteact with the parents as needed. This is the back end for this app.

# How it works

All the CURD operations are exposed to the UI as RESTFul calls. All the API calls are built using Ruby on Rails and the backend data is stored in Prostgres database.

# Tech behind this

The backed for the app is built on Ruby on Rails & PostgreSQL.

# Future enhancements / Known issues

Enhancements

#1 - Add a calendar view so that a parent can look at the activity for any given day
#2 - Give ability for teacher to correct/update an activity
#3 - Add offline chat like interaction between teachers and parents
